    <p>This pizza comes from the website, allrecipes.com and was originally given by Lynda Q. Some pizzas have a thick crust, but this one has a thin crust ideal for those out there that want to enjoy pizza but have braces or more brittle teeth that may not be able to handle thicker crusts without issues. This pizza will very well be scrumptious as a result of that.</p>

    <ul>
     <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
